# Multi-Tiered-Hybrid-Intrusion-Detection-System-for-Internet-of-Vehicles
A Multi-Tiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a security solution designed to protect the communication and data exchange within a connected vehicle network. The IoV refers to the interconnected network of vehicles, infrastructure, and other devices that enable advanced transportation systems.

The IDS aims to detect and prevent intrusion attempts or malicious activities that may compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the IoV. It combines multiple layers or tiers of detection techniques, leveraging both traditional rule-based approaches and machine learning algorithms for enhanced accuracy and effectiveness.

The system typically consists of three main tiers:

    Network-Based Detection: This tier focuses on monitoring the communication between vehicles and infrastructure elements. It analyzes network traffic, such as packet headers and payload, to identify anomalies, known attack patterns, or suspicious behaviors. This detection can be based on rule-based signatures, anomaly detection algorithms, or statistical models.

    Host-Based Detection: This tier concentrates on the individual vehicles' internal systems, including their onboard computers or electronic control units. It monitors the activities and events occurring within these systems, such as software executions, system calls, or resource usage. Any deviations from normal behavior or known attack patterns trigger alerts for potential intrusions.

    Behavior-Based Detection: This tier focuses on the behavior of vehicles and their interactions within the IoV. It leverages machine learning techniques to establish baselines of normal behavior for individual vehicles or the overall system. Any deviations or anomalies in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) interactions are detected and flagged as potential security threats.

The multi-tiered hybrid IDS combines the strengths of each tier to provide a comprehensive defense against a wide range of intrusion attempts. By analyzing network traffic, internal system events, and behavioral patterns, it can effectively detect and mitigate attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS), unauthorized access, data tampering, or spoofing.

The system can generate real-time alerts, trigger automated responses, or notify human operators for further investigation and mitigation actions. Additionally, the IDS can continuously update its knowledge base by incorporating new attack signatures, machine learning models, or system behavior profiles to adapt to emerging threats and evolving IoV environments.

Overall, a Multi-Tiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Vehicles enhances the security posture of connected vehicles, mitigates risks, and ensures the safe and secure operation of the IoV ecosystem.
 
***I here add the relavent python code for your reference. Here specially I need to mention those who create this code and I got it and make more secure and develop some new parts as for my project.***
